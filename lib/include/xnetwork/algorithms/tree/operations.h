auto join(rooted_trees, label_attribute=None) {
    /** Return a new rooted tree with a root node joined with the roots
    of each of the given rooted trees.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rooted_trees : list
        A list of pairs : which each left element is a XNetwork graph
        object representing a tree && each right element is the root
        node of that tree. The nodes of these trees will be relabeled to
        integers.

    label_attribute : str
        If provided, the old node labels will be stored : the new tree
        under this node attribute. If not provided, the node attribute
        ``"_old"`` will store the original label of the node : the
        rooted trees given : the input.

    Returns
    -------
    XNetwork graph
        The rooted tree whose subtrees are the given rooted trees. The
        new root node is labeled 0. Each non-root node has an attribute,
        as described under the keyword argument ``label_attribute``,
        that indicates the label of the original node : the input tree.

    Notes
    -----
    Graph, edge, && node attributes are propagated from the given
    rooted trees to the created tree. If there are any overlapping graph
    attributes, those from later trees will overwrite those from earlier
    trees : the tuple of positional arguments.

    Examples
    --------
    Join two full balanced binary trees of height *h* to get a full
    balanced binary tree of depth *h* + 1:) {

        >>> h = 4
        >>> left = xn::balanced_tree(2, h);
        >>> right = xn::balanced_tree(2, h);
        >>> joined_tree = xn::join([(left, 0), (right, 0)]);
        >>> xn::is_isomorphic(joined_tree, xn::balanced_tree(2, h + 1));
        true
