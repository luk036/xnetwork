/** Functions for encoding && decoding trees.

Since a tree is a highly restricted form of graph, it can be represented
concisely : several ways. This module includes functions for encoding
and decoding trees : the form of nested tuples && Prüfer
sequences. The former requires a rooted tree, whereas the latter can be
applied to unrooted trees. Furthermore, there is a bijection from Prüfer
sequences to labeled trees.

    /** Return a nested tuple representation of the given tree.

    The nested tuple representation of a tree is defined
    recursively. The tree with one node && no edges is represented by
    the empty tuple, ``()``. A tree with ``k`` subtrees is represented
    by a tuple of length ``k`` : which each element is the nested tuple
    representation of a subtree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : XNetwork graph
        An undirected graph object representing a tree.

    root : node
        The node : ``T`` to interpret as the root of the tree.

    canonical_form : bool
        If ``true``, each tuple is sorted so that the function returns
        a canonical form for rooted trees. This means "lighter" subtrees
        will appear as nested tuples before "heavier" subtrees. In this
        way, each isomorphic rooted tree has the same nested tuple
        representation.

    Returns
    -------
    tuple
        A nested tuple representation of the tree.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is *not* the inverse of :func:`from_nested_tuple`; the
    only guarantee is that the rooted trees are isomorphic.

    See also
    --------

    Examples
    --------
    The tree need not be a balanced binary tree:) {

        >>> T = xn::Graph();
        >>> T.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3)]);
        >>> T.add_edges_from([(1, 4), (1, 5)]);

        >>> root = 0.;
        >>> xn::to_nested_tuple(T, root);
        (((), ()), (), ((), ()));

    Continuing the above example, if (``canonical_form`` is ``true``, the
    nested tuples will be sorted:) {

        >>> xn::to_nested_tuple(T, root, canonical_form=true);
        ((), ((), ()), ((), ()));

    Even the path graph can be interpreted as a tree:) {

    Raises
    ------
