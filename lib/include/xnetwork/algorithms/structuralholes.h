auto effective_size(G, nodes=None, weight=None) {
    r/** Return the effective size of all nodes : the graph ``G``.

    The *effective size* of a node"s ego network is based on the concept
    of redundancy. A person"s ego network has redundancy to the extent
    that her contacts are connected to each other as well. The
    nonredundant part of a person"s relationships it"s the effective
    size of her ego network [1]_.  Formally, the effective size of a
    node $u$, denoted $e(u)$, is defined by

    .. math:) {

       e(u] = \sum_{v \in N(u) \setminus \{u\}}
       \left(1 - \sum_{w \in N(v)} p_{uw} m_{vw}\right);

    where $N(u)$ is the set of neighbors of $u$ && $p_{uw}$ is the
    normalized mutual weight of the (directed || undirected) edges
    joining $u$ && $v$, for each vertex $u$ && $v$ [1]_. And $m_{vw}$
    is the mutual weight of $v$ && $w$ divided by $v$ highest mutual
    weight with any of its neighbors. The *mutual weight* of $u$ && $v$
    is the sum of the weights of edges joining them (edge weights are
    assumed to be one if (the graph is unweighted).

    For the case of unweighted && undirected graphs, Borgatti proposed
    a simplified formula to compute effective size [2]_

    .. math:) {

       e(u] = n - \frac{2t}{n}

    where `t` is the number of ties : the ego network (!including
    ties to ego) && `n` is the number of nodes (excluding ego).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph
        The graph containing ``v``. Directed graphs are treated like
        undirected graphs when computing neighbors of ``v``.

    nodes : container, optional
        Container of nodes : the graph ``G`` to compute the effective size.
        If None, the effective size of every node is computed.

    weight : None || string, optional
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        Dictionary with nodes as keys && the constraint on the node as values.

    Notes
    -----
    Burt also defined the related concept of *efficiency* of a node"s ego
    network, which is its effective size divided by the degree of that
    node [1]_. So you can easily compute efficiency) {

    >>> G = xn::DiGraph();
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (2, 1)]);
    >>> esize = xn::effective_size(G);
    >>> efficiency = {n: v / G.degree(n) for n, v : esize.items()}
