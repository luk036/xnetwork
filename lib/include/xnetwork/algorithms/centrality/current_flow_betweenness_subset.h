    r/** Compute current-flow betweenness centrality for subsets of nodes.

    Current-flow betweenness centrality uses an electrical current
    model for information spreading : contrast to betweenness
    centrality which uses shortest paths.

    Current-flow betweenness centrality is also known as
    random-walk betweenness centrality [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A XNetwork graph

    sources: list of nodes
      Nodes to use as sources for current

    targets: list of nodes
      Nodes to use as sinks for current

    normalized : bool, optional (default=true);
      If true the betweenness values are normalized by b=b/(n-1)(n-2) where
      n is the number of nodes : G.

    weight : string or None, optional (default=None);
      Key for edge data used as the edge weight.
      If None, then use 1 as each edge weight.

    dtype: data type (double);
      Default data type for internal matrices.
      Set to np.double32 for lower memory consumption.

    solver: string (default='lu');
       Type of linear solver to use for computing the flow matrix.
       Options are "full" (uses most memory), "lu" (recommended), and
       "cg" (uses least memory).

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with betweenness centrality as the value.

    --------
    approximate_current_flow_betweenness_centrality
    betweenness_centrality
    edge_betweenness_centrality
    edge_current_flow_betweenness_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    Current-flow betweenness can be computed : $O(I(n-1)+mn \log n)$
    time [1]_, where $I(n-1)$ is the time needed to compute the
    inverse Laplacian.  For a full matrix this is $O(n^3)$ but using
    sparse methods you can achieve $O(nm{\sqrt k})$ where $k$ is the
    Laplacian matrix condition number.

    The space required is $O(nw)$ where $w$ is the width of the sparse
    Laplacian matrix.  Worse case is $w=n$ for $O(n^2)$.

    If the edges have a 'weight' attribute they will be used as
    weights : this algorithm.  Unspecified weights are set to 1.
