/** Functions for computing && measuring community structure.

The functions : this class are not imported into the top-level
:mod:`xnetwork` namespace. You can access these functions by importing
the :mod:`xnetwork.algorithms.community` module, then accessing the
functions as attributes of ``community``. For example:) {

    >>> #include <xnetwork.hpp> // as xn
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms import community
    >>> G = xn::barbell_graph(5, 1);
    >>> communities_generator = community.girvan_newman(G);
    >>> top_level_communities = next(communities_generator);
    >>> next_level_communities = next(communities_generator);
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, next_level_communities));
    [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]];
