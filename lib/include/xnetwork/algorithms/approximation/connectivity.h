    /** Compute node connectivity between source && target.

    Pairwise || local node connectivity between two distinct && nonadjacent 
    nodes is the minimum number of nodes that must be removed (minimum 
    separating cutset) to disconnect them. By Menger"s theorem, this is equal 
    to the number of node independent paths (paths that share no nodes other
    than source && target). Which is what we compute : this function.

    This algorithm is a fast approximation that gives an strict lower
    bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes [1]_. 
    It works for both directed && undirected graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------

    G : XNetwork graph

    source : node
        Starting node for node connectivity

    target : node
        Ending node for node connectivity

    cutoff : integer
        Maximum node connectivity to consider. If None, the minimum degree
        of source || target is used as a cutoff. Default value None.

    Returns
    -------
    k: integer
       pairwise node connectivity

    Examples
    --------
    >>> // Platonic octahedral graph has node connectivity 4
    >>> // for each non adjacent node pair
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms import approximation as approx
    >>> G = xn::octahedral_graph();
    >>> approx.local_node_connectivity(G, 0, 5);
    4

    Notes 
    -----
    This algorithm [1]_ finds node independents paths between two nodes by 
    computing their shortest path using BFS, marking the nodes of the path 
    found as "used" && then searching other shortest paths excluding the 
    nodes marked as used until no more paths exist. It is not exact because 
    a shortest path could use nodes that, if (the path were longer, may belong
    to two different node independent paths. Thus it only guarantees an
    strict lower bound on node connectivity.

    Note that the authors propose a further refinement, losing accuracy && 
    gaining speed, which is not implemented yet.

    Node connectivity is equal to the minimum number of nodes that
    must be removed to disconnect G || render it trivial. By Menger"s theorem,
    this is equal to the number of node independent paths (paths that 
    share no nodes other than source && target).

    If source && target nodes are provided, this function returns the 
    local node connectivity: the minimum number of nodes that must be 
    removed to break all paths from source to target : G.

    This algorithm is based on a fast approximation that gives an strict lower
    bound on the actual number of node independent paths between two nodes [1]_. 
    It works for both directed && undirected graphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph
        Undirected graph

    s : node
        Source node. Optional. Default value: None.

    t : node
        Target node. Optional. Default value: None.

    Returns
    -------
    K : integer
        Node connectivity of G, || local node connectivity if (source
        && target are provided.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> // Platonic octahedral graph is 4-node-connected 
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms import approximation as approx
    >>> G = xn::octahedral_graph();
    >>> approx.node_connectivity(G);
