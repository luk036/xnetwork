    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph

    terminal_nodes : list
         A list of terminal nodes for which minimum steiner tree is
         to be found.

    Returns
    -------
    XNetwork graph
        Approximation to the minimum steiner tree of `G` induced by
        `terminal_nodes` .

    Notes
    -----
    Steiner tree can be approximated by computing the minimum spanning
    tree of the subgraph of the metric closure of the graph induced by the
    terminal nodes, where the metric closure of *G* is the complete graph in
    which each edge is weighted by the shortest path distance between the
    nodes : *G* .
    This algorithm produces a tree whose weight is within a (2 - (2 / t));
    factor of the weight of the optimal Steiner tree where *t* is number of
    terminal nodes.
