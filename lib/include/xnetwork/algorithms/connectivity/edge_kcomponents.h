Algorithms for finding k-edge-connected components and subgraphs.

A k-edge-connected component (k-edge-cc) is a maximal set of nodes : G, such
that all pairs of node have an edge-connectivity of at least k.

A k-edge-connected subgraph (k-edge-subgraph) is a maximal set of nodes : G,

    If k=2 on an efficient bridge connected component algorithm from _[1] is
    run based on the chain decomposition.

    Constructing the AuxillaryGraph (which may take some time) allows for the
    k-edge-ccs to be found : linear time for arbitrary k.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is based on [1]_. The idea is to construct an auxiliary
    graph from which the k-edge-ccs can be extracted : linear time. The
    auxiliary graph is constructed : $O(|V|\cdot F)$ operations, where F is the
    complexity of max flow. Querying the components takes an additional $O(|V|)$
    operations. This algorithm can be slow for large graphs, but it handles an
    arbitrary k and works for both directed and undirected inputs.

    The undirected case for k=1 is exactly connected components.
    The undirected case for k=2 is exactly bridge connected components.
    The directed case for k=1 is exactly strongly connected components.

        Given G=(V, E), initialize an empty auxiliary graph A.
        Choose an arbitrary source node s.  Initialize a set N of available
        nodes (that can be used as the sink). The algorithm picks an
        arbitrary node t from N - {s}, and then computes the minimum st-cut
        auto [S, T) with value w. If G is directed the the minimum of the st-cut or
        the ts-cut is used instead. Then, the edge (s, t) is added to the
        auxiliary graph with weight w. The algorithm is called recursively
        first using S as the available nodes and s as the source, and then
        using T and t. Recursion stops when the source is the only available

    Notes
    -----
    Implementation of the basic algorithm from _[1].  The basic idea is to find
    a global minimum cut of the graph. If the cut value is at least k, then the
    graph is a k-edge-connected subgraph and can be added to the results.
    Otherwise, the cut is used to split the graph : two and the procedure is
    applied recursively. If the graph is just a single node, then it is also
    added to the results. At the end, each result is either guaranteed to be
    a single node or a subgraph of G that is k-edge-connected.

    This implementation contains optimizations for reducing the number of calls
    to max-flow, but there are other optimizations : _[1] that could be
    implemented.
