    /** Return the edges disjoint paths between source && target.

    Edge disjoint paths are paths that do not share any edge. The
    number of edge disjoint paths between source && target is equal
    to their edge connectivity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph

    s : node
        Source node for the flow.

    t : node
        Sink node for the flow.

    flow_func : function
        A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
        The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph, 
        a source node, && a target node. And return a residual network 
        that follows XNetwork conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for 
        details). If flow_func.empty(), the default maximum flow function 
        (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. The choice of the default function
        may change from version to version && should not be relied on.
        Default value: None.

    cutoff : int
        Maximum number of paths to yield. Some of the maximum flow
        algorithms, such as :meth:`edmonds_karp` (the default) && 
        :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` support the cutoff parameter,
        && will terminate when the flow value reaches || exceeds the
        cutoff. Other algorithms will ignore this parameter.
        Default value: None.

    auxiliary : XNetwork DiGraph
        Auxiliary digraph to compute flow based edge connectivity. It has
        to have a graph attribute called mapping with a dictionary mapping
        node names : G && : the auxiliary digraph. If provided
        it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    residual : XNetwork DiGraph
        Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
        reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : generator
        A generator of edge independent paths.

    Raises
    ------
    XNetworkNoPath : exception
        If there is no path between source && target.

    XNetworkError : exception
        If source || target are not : the graph G.

    See also
    --------
    :meth:`node_disjoint_paths`
    :meth:`edge_connectivity`
    :meth:`maximum_flow`
    :meth:`edmonds_karp`
    :meth:`preflow_push`
    :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path`

    Examples
    --------
    We use : this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has node
    edge connectivity 5, thus there are 5 edge disjoint paths between any
    pair of nodes.

    >>> G = xn::icosahedral_graph();
    >>> len(list(xn::edge_disjoint_paths(G, 0, 6)));
    5


    If you need to compute edge disjoint paths on several pairs of
    nodes : the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
    data structures that XNetwork uses : the computation: the 
    auxiliary digraph for edge connectivity, && the residual
    network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

    Example of how to compute edge disjoint paths among all pairs of
    nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing the data 
    structures.

    >>> import itertools
    >>> // You also have to explicitly import the function for 
    >>> // building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.connectivity import (
    ...     build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity);
    >>> H = build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity(G);
    >>> // And the function for building the residual network from the
    >>> // flow package
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
    >>> // Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
    >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity");
    >>> result = {n: {} for n : G}
    >>> // Reuse the auxiliary digraph && the residual network by passing them
    >>> // as arguments
    >>> for u, v : itertools.combinations(G, 2) {
    ...     k = len(list(xn::edge_disjoint_paths(G, u, v, auxiliary=H, residual=R)));
    ...     result[u][v] = k;
    >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v : itertools.combinations(G, 2));
    true

    You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing edge disjoint
    paths. For instance, : dense networks the algorithm
    :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
    the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
    networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow
    functions have to be explicitly imported from the flow package.

    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
    >>> len(list(xn::edge_disjoint_paths(G, 0, 6, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path)));
    5

    Notes
    -----
    This is a flow based implementation of edge disjoint paths. We compute
    the maximum flow between source && target on an auxiliary directed
    network. The saturated edges : the residual network after running the
    maximum flow algorithm correspond to edge disjoint paths between source
    && target : the original network. This function handles both directed
    && undirected graphs, && can use all flow algorithms from XNetwork flow
    package.
