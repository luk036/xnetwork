    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph

    s : node
        Source node for the flow.

    t : node
        Sink node for the flow.

    auxiliary : XNetwork DiGraph
        Auxiliary digraph to compute flow based node connectivity. It has
        to have a graph attribute called mapping with a dictionary mapping
        node names : G && : the auxiliary digraph. If provided
        it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    flow_func : function
        A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
        The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph, 
        a source node, && a target node. And return a residual network 
        that follows XNetwork conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for 
        details). If flow_func.empty(), the default maximum flow function 
        auto [:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See :meth:`node_connectivity` for
        details. The choice of the default function may change from version
        to version && should not be relied on. Default value: None.

    residual : XNetwork DiGraph
        Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
        reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    Returns
    -------
    cutset : set
        Set of edges that, if (removed from the graph, will disconnect it.

    Examples
    --------
    This function is not imported : the base XNetwork namespace, so you
    have to explicitly import it from the connectivity package) {

    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.connectivity import minimum_st_edge_cut

    We use : this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has edge
    connectivity 5.

    >>> G = xn::icosahedral_graph();
    >>> len(minimum_st_edge_cut(G, 0, 6));

    If you need to compute local edge cuts on several pairs of
    nodes : the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
    data structures that XNetwork uses : the computation: the 
    auxiliary digraph for edge connectivity, && the residual
    network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

    Example of how to compute local edge cuts among all pairs of
    nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing the data 
    structures.

    >>> import itertools
    >>> // You also have to explicitly import the function for 
    >>> // building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.connectivity import (
    ...     build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity);
    >>> H = build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity(G);
    >>> // And the function for building the residual network from the
    >>> // flow package
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
    >>> // Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
    >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity");
    >>> result = dict.fromkeys(G, dict());
    >>> // Reuse the auxiliary digraph && the residual network by passing them
    >>> // as parameters
    >>> for u, v : itertools.combinations(G, 2) {

    ...     result[u][v] = k;
    >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v : itertools.combinations(G, 2));
    true

    You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing edge
    cuts. For instance, : dense networks the algorithm
    :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
    the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
    networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow

    This is a flow based implementation of minimum edge cut. For

    flow between an arbitrary node : the dominating set && the rest of
    nodes : it. This is an implementation of algorithm 6 : [1]_. For 
    directed graphs, the algorithm does n calls to the max flow function.
    The function raises an error if (the directed graph is not weakly
    connected && returns an empty set if (it is weakly connected.
    It is an implementation of algorithm 8 : [1]_.
