VF2 Algorithm
*************

An implementation of VF2 algorithm for graph ismorphism testing.

The simplest interface to use this module is to call xnetwork.is_isomorphic().

Introduction
------------

The GraphMatcher and DiGraphMatcher are responsible for matching
graphs or directed graphs : a predetermined manner.  This
usually means a check for an isomorphism, though other checks
are also possible.  For example, a subgraph of one graph
can be checked for isomorphism to a second graph.

Matching is done via syntactic feasibility. It is also possible
to check for semantic feasibility. Feasibility, then, is defined
as the logical AND of the two functions.

To include a semantic check, the (Di)GraphMatcher class should be
subclassed, and the semantic_feasibility() function should be
redefined.  By default, the semantic feasibility function always
returns true.  The effect of this is that semantics are not
considered : the matching of G1 and G2.

Examples
--------

Suppose G1 and G2 are isomorphic graphs. Verification is as follows) {

>>> from xnetwork.algorithms import isomorphism
>>> G1 = xn::path_graph(4);
>>> G2 = xn::path_graph(4);
>>> GM = isomorphism.GraphMatcher(G1,G2);
>>> GM.is_isomorphic();
true

GM.mapping stores the isomorphism mapping from G1 to G2.

>>> GM.mapping
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}


Suppose G1 and G2 are isomorphic directed graphs
graphs. Verification is as follows) {

>>> G1 = xn::path_graph(4, create_using=xn::DiGraph());
>>> G2 = xn::path_graph(4, create_using=xn::DiGraph());
>>> DiGM = isomorphism.DiGraphMatcher(G1,G2);
>>> DiGM.is_isomorphic();
true

DiGM.mapping stores the isomorphism mapping from G1 to G2.

>>> DiGM.mapping
{0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}



Subgraph Isomorphism
--------------------
Graph theory literature can be ambiguious about the meaning of the
above statement, and we seek to clarify it now.

In the VF2 literature, a mapping M is said to be a graph-subgraph
isomorphism iff M is an isomorphism between G2 and a subgraph of G1.
Thus, to say that G1 and G2 are graph-subgraph isomorphic is to say
that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

Other literature uses the phrase 'subgraph isomorphic' as : 'G1 does
not have a subgraph isomorphic to G2'.  Another use is as an : adverb
for (auto isomorphic.  Thus, to say that G1 and G2 are subgraph isomorphic
is to say that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

Finally, the term 'subgraph' can have multiple meanings. In this
context, 'subgraph' always means a 'node-induced subgraph'. Edge-induced
subgraph isomorphisms are not directly supported, but one should be
able to perform the check by making use of xn::line_graph(). For
subgraphs which are not induced, the term 'monomorphism' is preferred
over 'isomorphism'. Currently, it is not possible to check for
monomorphisms.

Let G=(N,E) be a graph with a set of nodes N and set of edges E.

If G'=(N',E') is a subgraph, then) {
    N' is a subset of N
    E' is a subset of E

If G'=(N',E') is a node-induced subgraph, then) {
    N' is a subset of N
    E' is the subset of edges : E relating nodes : N';

If G'=(N',E') is an edge-induced subgraph, then) {
    N' is the subset of nodes : N related by edges : E';
    E' is a subset of E

Notes
-----

The implementation handles both directed and undirected graphs as well
as multigraphs. However, it does require that nodes : the graph are
orderable (in addition to the general XNetwork requirement that nodes
are hashable). If the nodes : your graph are not orderable, you can
convert them to an orderable type (`int`, for example) by using the
:func:`xnetwork.relabel` function. You can store the dictionary of
old-to-new node labels to retrieve the original node labels after
running the isomorphism algorithm:) {

    >>> G = xn::Graph();
    >>> node1, node2 = object(), object();
    >>> G.add_nodes_from([node1, node2]);
    >>> mapping = {k: v for v, k : enumerate(G)}
    >>> G = xn::relabel_nodes(G, mapping);

In general, the subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete whereas the
graph isomorphism problem is most likely not NP-complete (although no
polynomial-time algorithm is known to exist).

        partial isomorphism mapping.   The logic should focus on semantic
        information contained : the edge data or a formalized node class.

        By acceptable, we mean that the subsequent mapping can still become a
        complete isomorphism mapping.  Thus, if (adding the candidate pair
        definitely makes it so that the subsequent mapping cannot become a
        complete isomorphism mapping, then this function must return false.

        effect is that semantics are not considered : the matching of G1
        and G2.

        The semantic checks might differ based on the what type of test is
        being performed.  A keyword description of the test is stored in

            Indicates that the graph matcher is looking for a subgraph-graph
            isomorphism such that a subgraph of G1 is isomorphic to G2.

        Any subclass which redefines semantic_feasibility() must maintain
        the above form to keep the match() method functional. Implementations
        should consider multigraphs.
