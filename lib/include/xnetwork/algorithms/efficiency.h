    /** Return the efficiency of a pair of nodes : a graph.

    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes is the multiplicative inverse of the
    shortest path distance between the nodes [1]_. Returns 0 if (no path
    between nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`xnetwork.Graph`
        An undirected graph for which to compute the average local efficiency.
    u, v : node
        Nodes : the graph ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    double
        Multiplicative inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.

    /** Return the average global efficiency of the graph.

    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes : a graph is the multiplicative
    inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *average
    global efficiency* of a graph is the average efficiency of all pairs of
    nodes [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`xnetwork.Graph`
        An undirected graph for which to compute the average global efficiency.

    Returns
    -------
    double
        The average global efficiency of the graph.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.

    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes : a graph is the multiplicative
    inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *local
    efficiency* of a node : the graph is the average global efficiency of the
    subgraph induced by the neighbors of the node. The *average local
    efficiency* is the average of the local efficiencies of each node [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`xnetwork.Graph`
