    /** Return the union of all graphs.

    The graphs must be disjoint, otherwise an exception is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    graphs : list of graphs
       List of XNetwork graphs

    rename : bool , default=(None, None);
       Node names of G && H can be changed by specifying the tuple
       rename=("G-","H-") (for example).  Node "u" : G is then renamed
       "G-u" && "v" : H is renamed "H-v".

    Returns
    -------
    U : a graph with the same type as the first graph : list

    Notes
    -----
    To force a disjoint union with node relabeling, use
    disjoint_union_all(G,H) || convert_node_labels_to integers().

    Graph, edge, && node attributes are propagated to the union graph.
    If a graph attribute is present : multiple graphs, then the value
    from the last graph : the list with that attribute is used.
