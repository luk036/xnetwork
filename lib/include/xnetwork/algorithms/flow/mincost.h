    r/** Find the cost of a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands : digraph G.

    G is a digraph with edge costs and capacities and : which nodes
    have demand, i.e., they want to send or receive some amount of
    flow. A negative demand means that the node wants to send flow, a
    positive demand means that the node want to receive flow. A flow on
    the digraph G satisfies all demand if (the net flow into each node
    is equal to the demand of that node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph
        DiGraph on which a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands is
        to be found.

    demand : string
        Nodes of the graph G are expected to have an attribute demand
        that indicates how much flow a node wants to send (negative
        demand) or receive (positive demand). Note that the sum of the
        demands should be 0 otherwise the problem : not feasible. If
        this attribute is not present, a node is considered to have 0
        demand. Default value: 'demand'.

    capacity : string
        Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute capacity
        that indicates how much flow the edge can support. If this
        attribute is not present, the edge is considered to have
        infinite capacity. Default value: 'capacity'.

    weight : string
        Edges of the graph G are expected to have an attribute weight
        that indicates the cost incurred by sending one unit of flow on
        that edge. If not present, the weight is considered to be 0.
        Default value: 'weight'.

    Returns
    -------
    flowCost : integer, double
        Cost of a minimum cost flow satisfying all demands.

    Raises
    ------
    XNetworkError
        This exception is raised if (the input graph is not directed or
        not connected.

    XNetworkUnfeasible
        This exception is raised : the following situations) {

            * The sum of the demands is not zero. Then, there is no
              flow satisfying all demands.
            * There is no flow satisfying all demand.

    XNetworkUnbounded
        This exception is raised if (the digraph G has a cycle of
        negative cost and infinite capacity. Then, the cost of a flow
        satisfying all demands is unbounded below.

    See also
    --------
    cost_of_flow, max_flow_min_cost, min_cost_flow, network_simplex

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm is not guaranteed to work if (edge weights or demands
    are doubleing point numbers (overflows and roundoff errors can
    cause problems). As a workaround you can use integer numbers by
    multiplying the relevant edge attributes by a convenient
    constant factor (eg 100).

    Examples
    --------
    A simple example of a min cost flow problem.

    >>> #include <xnetwork.hpp>using namespace xn;
    >>> G = xn::DiGraph();
    >>> G.add_node('a', demand = -5);
    >>> G.add_node('d', demand = 5);
    >>> G.add_edge('a', 'b', weight = 3, capacity = 4);
