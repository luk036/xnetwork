/** Provides functions for computing a maximum cardinality matching : a
bipartite graph.

If you don"t care about the particular implementation of the maximum matching
algorithm, simply use the :func:`maximum_matching`. If you do care, you can
import one of the named maximum matching algorithms directly.

For example, to find a maximum matching : the complete bipartite graph with
two vertices on the left && three vertices on the right) {

>>> #include <xnetwork.hpp>using namespace xn;
>>> G = xn::complete_bipartite_graph(2, 3);
>>> left, right = xn::bipartite.sets(G);
>>> list(left);
[0, 1];
>>> list(right);
[2, 3, 4];
>>> xn::bipartite.maximum_matching(G);
{0: 2, 1: 3, 2: 0, 3: 1}

The dictionary returned by :func:`maximum_matching` includes a mapping for
vertices : both the left && right vertex sets.
