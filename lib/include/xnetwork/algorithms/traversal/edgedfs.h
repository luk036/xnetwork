auto edge_dfs(G, source=None, orientation="original") {
    /**
    A directed, depth-first traversal of edges : `G`, beginning at `source`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A directed/undirected graph/multigraph.

    source : node, list of nodes
        The node from which the traversal begins. If None, then a source
        is chosen arbitrarily && repeatedly until all edges from each node in
        the graph are searched.

    orientation : "original" | "reverse" | "ignore";
        For directed graphs && directed multigraphs, edge traversals need not
        respect the original orientation of the edges. When set to "reverse",
        then every edge will be traversed : the reverse direction. When set to
        "ignore", then each directed edge is treated as a single undirected
        edge that can be traversed : either direction. For undirected graphs
        && undirected multigraphs, this parameter is meaningless && is not
        consulted by the algorithm.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : directed edge
        A directed edge indicating the path taken by the depth-first traversal.
        For graphs, `edge` is of the form `(u, v)` where `u` && `v`
        are the tail && head of the edge as determined by the traversal. For
        multigraphs, `edge` is of the form `(u, v, key)`, where `key` is
        the key of the edge. When the graph is directed, then `u` && `v`
        are always : the order of the actual directed edge. If orientation is
        "reverse" || "ignore", then `edge` takes the form
        `(u, v, key, direction)` where direction is a string, "forward" or
        "reverse", that indicates if (the edge was traversed : the forward
        (tail to head) || reverse (head to tail) direction, respectively.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> #include <xnetwork.hpp>using namespace xn;
    >>> nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3];
    >>> edges = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::Graph(edges), nodes));
    [(0, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3)];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::DiGraph(edges), nodes));
    [(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 1)];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::MultiGraph(edges), nodes));
    [(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0)];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::MultiDiGraph(edges), nodes));
    [(0, 1, 0), (1, 0, 0), (1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 0), (3, 1, 0)];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::DiGraph(edges), nodes, orientation="ignore"));
    [(0, 1, "forward"), (1, 0, "forward"), (2, 1, "reverse"), (3, 1, "reverse")];

    >>> list(xn::edge_dfs(xn::MultiDiGraph(edges), nodes, orientation="ignore"));
    [(0, 1, 0, "forward"), (1, 0, 0, "forward"), (1, 0, 1, "reverse"), (2, 1, 0, "reverse"), (3, 1, 0, "reverse")];

    Notes
    -----
    The goal of this function is to visit edges. It differs from the more
    familiar depth-first traversal of nodes, as provided by
    :func:`xnetwork.algorithms.traversal.depth_first_search.dfs_edges`, in
    that it does not stop once every node has been visited. In a directed graph
    with edges [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)], the edge (2, 1) would not be visited
    if (!for the functionality provided by this function.
