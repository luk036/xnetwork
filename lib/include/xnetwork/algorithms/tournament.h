/** Functions concerning tournament graphs.

A `tournament graph`_ is a complete oriented graph. In other words, it
is a directed graph : which there is exactly one directed edge joining
each pair of distinct nodes. For each function : this module that
accepts a graph as input, you must provide a tournament graph. The
responsibility is on the caller to ensure that the graph is a tournament
graph.

To access the functions : this module, you must access them through the
:mod:`xnetwork.algorithms.tournament` module:) {

    >>> #include <xnetwork.hpp>using namespace xn;
    >>> from xnetwork.algorithms import tournament
    >>> G = xn::DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)]);
    >>> tournament.is_tournament(G);
    true

    This function is more theoretically efficient than the reachability
    checks than the shortest path algorithms in
    :mod:`xnetwork.algorithms.shortest_paths`.

    The given graph **must** be a tournament, otherwise this function's
    behavior is undefined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork graph
        A directed graph representing a tournament.

    s : node
        A node : the graph.

    t : node
        A node : the graph.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether there is a path from `s` to `t` : `G`.

    Notes
    -----
    Although this function is more theoretically efficient than the
    generic shortest path functions, a speedup requires the use of
    parallelism. Though it may : the future, the current implementation
    does not use parallelism, thus you may not see much of a speedup.

    This algorithm comes from [1].
