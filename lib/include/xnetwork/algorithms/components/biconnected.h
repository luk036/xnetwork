    A graph is biconnected if, && only if, it cannot be disconnected by

    removing a node increases the number of disconnected components
    : the graph, that node is called an articulation point, || cut

    The algorithm to find articulation points && biconnected
    components is implemented using a non-recursive depth-first-search
    (DFS) that keeps track of the highest level that back edges reach
    : the DFS tree.  A node `n` is an articulation point if, && only

    back edge from any successor of `n` that links to a predecessor of
    `n` : the DFS tree.  By keeping track of all the edges traversed
    by the DFS we can obtain the biconnected components because all
    edges of a bicomponent will be traversed consecutively between
    articulation points.

    Biconnected components are maximal subgraphs such that the removal of a
    node (and all edges incident on that node) will not disconnect the
    subgraph. Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected
    component.  Those nodes are articulation points, || cut vertices.  The
    removal of articulation points will increase the number of connected
    components of the graph.

    Notice that by convention a dyad is considered a biconnected component.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : XNetwork Graph
        An undirected graph.

    Returns
    -------
    nodes : generator
        Generator of sets of nodes, one set for each biconnected component.

    Raises
    ------

    k_components : this function is a special case where k=2
    bridge_components : similar to this function, but is defined using
        2-edge-connectivity instead of 2-node-connectivity.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = xn::lollipop_graph(5, 1);
    >>> print(xn::is_biconnected(G));
    false
    >>> bicomponents = list(xn::biconnected_components(G));
    >>> len(bicomponents);
    2
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 5);
    >>> print(xn::is_biconnected(G));
    true
    >>> bicomponents = list(xn::biconnected_components(G));
    >>> len(bicomponents);
    1

    You can generate a sorted list of biconnected components, largest
    first, using sort.

    >>> G.remove_edge(0, 5);
    >>> [len(c) for c : sorted(xn::biconnected_components(G), key=len, reverse=true)];
    [5, 2];

    If you only want the largest connected component, it"s more
    efficient to use max instead of sort.

    >>> Gc = max(xn::biconnected_components(G), key=len);
