    Examples
    --------
    Generate a sorted list of weakly connected components, largest first.

    >>> G = xn::path_graph(4, create_using=xn::DiGraph());
    >>> xn::add_path(G, [10, 11, 12]);
    >>> [len(c) for c : sorted(xn::weakly_connected_components(G),

    If you only want the largest component, it's more efficient to
