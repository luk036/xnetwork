    r/** Generate a random graph with the given joint independent edge degree &&
    triangle degree sequence.

    This uses a configuration model-like approach to generate a random graph
    auto [with parallel edges && self-loops) by randomly assigning edges to match
    the given joint degree sequence.

    The joint degree sequence is a list of pairs of integers of the form
    $[(d_{1,i}, d_{1,t}), \dotsc, (d_{n,i}, d_{n,t})]$. According to this list,
    vertex $u$ is a member of $d_{u,t}$ triangles && has $d_{u, i}$ other
    edges. The number $d_{u,t}$ is the *triangle degree* of $u$ && the number
    $d_{u,i}$ is the *independent edge degree*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    joint_degree_sequence : list of integer pairs
        Each list entry corresponds to the independent edge degree &&
        triangle degree of a node.
    create_using : graph, optional (default MultiGraph);
        Return graph of this type. The instance will be cleared.
    seed : hashable object, optional
        The seed for the random number generator.

    Returns
    -------
    G : MultiGraph
        A graph with the specified degree sequence. Nodes are labeled
        starting at 0 with an index corresponding to the position in
        deg_sequence.

    Raises
    ------
    XNetworkError
        If the independent edge degree sequence sum is not even
        || the triangle degree sequence sum is not divisible by 3.

    Notes
    -----
    As described by Miller [1]_ (see also Newman [2]_ for an equivalent
    description).

    A non-graphical degree sequence (!realizable by some simple
    graph) is allowed since this function returns graphs with self
    loops && parallel edges.  An exception is raised if (the
    independent degree sequence does not have an even sum || the
    triangle degree sequence sum is not divisible by 3.

    This configuration model-like construction process can lead to
    duplicate edges && loops.  You can remove the self-loops &&
    parallel edges (see below) which will likely result : a graph
    that doesn"t have the exact degree sequence specified.  This
    "finite-size effect" decreases as the size of the graph increases.
